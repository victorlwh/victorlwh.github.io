								<div class="container">
									<h4 style="margin-bottom: 1.2em;">1. Introduction</h4>
									<h5 style="font-size:1.15em">Background</h5>
									<p>Carbon emissions are known to be the prime contributor to Global Warming. Yet, there are only <a href='https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/31755'>15%</a> of the countries had adopted Carbon tax initiatives as of 2019.
										Among all the explanations, I am going to replicate my undergrad dissertation to prove people with present-bias (e.g. Procrastinators) are less likely to support environemntal tax with Python and R in this blog post.
									</p>
									<h5 style="font-size:1.15em">Time Discounting</h5>
									<p>
										To start with, we need to define what is <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_tax'>carbon tax</a> - by intentionally increasing the carbon cost, we discourage our over-consumption now for the future environmental benefit.
										And like an inverstment, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_preference'> time discounting</a> plays a role when deciding whehter to suppport a long-term tax policy.
										Essentially, we are putting a discount rate <i>(%)</i> on cash flows we will receive in the future.
										For example, I would prefer receiving $100 now than delaying it, as somehow, I feel like the same $100 would be of less value in a month, and it would further depreciate in a year.
										In other words, the more distant the environmental benefit, the less it meant to us at the present. The logic could be represented by <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_present_value'>Net Present Value</a> (\(NPV\)), 
										where \(t\) represents the period, \(T\) is the total number of periods, \(R_t\) is the cash flow at \(t\), and \(i\) is the interest rate:
										$$NPV(i,T) = \sum_{t=1}^T \frac{R_t}{(1+i)^t}$$
										From the equation above, we can see there are two factors that go to the opposite direction with \(NPV\), time \(t\), and the interest rate \(i\).
										In this case, we can also interpret \(i\) as the rate at which we discount values over time, or simply how impatient we are.
										As <a href='https://www.scholars.northwestern.edu/en/publications/individual-discount-rates-and-climate-change-is-discount-rate-ass'> Amdur et al. (2015)</a> proposed, <i><b>“individuals’ discount rate would be negatively correlated with their support for environmental taxation”</b></i>.
										Meaning people who are more impatient are less encouraged to support a long term policy like carbon tax.
										This is also going to be my <i><b>Hypothesis 1 (H1)</b></i>, which is principally supported in later sections, 
										and will be seen as an evidence to employ time discounting to the subject matter.
									</p>
									<h5 style="font-size:1.15em">Time Preference</h5>
									<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
										While Amdur’s research was one of the first to empirically link the magnitude of time discounting with individuals’ support for environmental policy, 
										their underlying assumption of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_inconsistency'>dynamic consistency</a> is debatable.
									</p>
									<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">	
										According to Samuelson's (1937) <a href= 'https://academic.oup.com/restud/article-abstract/4/2/155/1509754'>Discounted Utility Model</a>,
										economists only assumed a constant discount rate \(i\) for analytical convenience.
										(For those who are interested: a constant discount rate means the marginal rate of substitution between two deferred goods separated by a fixed lag should be stable across time.
										Individuals with such preference would be described as having an <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_discounting'>exponential discounting</a> function or a time consistent preference.
										(<a href='https://ideas.repec.org/p/nbr/nberwo/5635.html'>Laibson, 1996</a>))
										In <a href='https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9280.1995.tb00311.x'>Kirby's (1995, p.83)</a> words:
										<blockquote>If you would like a chocolate bar next Tuesday twice as much as an apple next Wednesday, you would like them in the same ratio for successive Tuesdays and Wednesdays a month, a year, or 10 years from now.</blockquote>										
										Instead of chocolate bar and apples, I am going to compare the rate at which an individual would be indifferent between separated financial rewards in different timeframes with a titration approach.
									</p>
									<h5 style="font-size:1.15em">Dynamic Inconsistency</h5>
									<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
										Unlike the classical belief on time <b>consistnet</b> preference adopted in Amdur’s research, recent studies have demonstrated dynamic inconsisteny (Fedrick et al., 2002). 
										This phenomena suggests some people might put higher weight on the present over future utility, (<b>Present-Biased</b>); or vice versa, (<b>Future-Biased</b>) (Goda et al., 2019).
									</p>
									<p>
										For an present-bias example, you realised there was an approaching deadline on Day 1, and you thought you would start the next day. But on Day 2, you were impatient about the new Netflix series and postponed your wish to work to Day 3... 
										People with such procrastinating behaviour are explained in Behavioural Economics as we would underestimate tomorrow's \((t+1)\) pleasure in today's \((t)\) point of view.
										Specifically, a present-biased individual would be increasingly impatient (i.e. associate higher discount rate) as an intertemporal choice approaches. 
										From studies, such discounter would over-pursue immediate gratification, and be more likely to bear credit-card debt or have poor health status (O'Donoghue and Rabin, 2015; Meier and Sprenger, 2010; Ikeda et al., 2010). 
									</p>	
									<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;"> Following this rationale, I propose individuals with such time preference would care more on the short-term sacrifices in paying additional tax, and weight less on the distant benefit of climate mitigation.
										Hence, <i><b>Hypothesis 2 (H2)</b></i> is that <i><b>“individuals with present-bias would be less likely to support environmental taxation than individuals with consistent time preference”</b></i>.

									<h4 style="margin-bottom: 1.2em; margin-top: -2.5em;">2. Data & Methodology</h4>
									<p>
										To prove the two hypotheses, I am using the household survey data from the UK Understanding Society Innovation Panel released by the Economic and social Data of the UK Data Service. (Full acknowledgement in my GitHub Repository)
										Every year since Wave 1 in 2008, same group of selected household representatives, who replicates the demographics in Britain, would be re-interviewed face-to-face or through the internet (Jäckle et al., 2019).
										As experiment modules would change in each wave, only Wave 7 <i>(IP7)</i> in 2014 includes all three experiments that are related to the research purposes.
										Among the total of 2,826 participants aged 16 or above in <i>IP7</i>, only 495 of them had participated in all the relevant experiment modules.
									</p>
									<h5 style="font-size:1.15em">Methodology</h5>
									<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">										
										The questionare results are categorised into two datasets.
										Hence, I will firstly focus on classifying data from different experiment modules in <i>g_indresp_ip</i>, and converting them into meaningful variables with Python.
										Then I will identify those demographics information in <i>g_indall_ip</i> that would be of value.
										Once all variables are created, I will combine them into one dataframe before running the Ordered Probit regression model in R.
									</p>
									<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
										The following packages are imported to set up the Python environemnt:

									</pre>
									<h5 style="font-size:1.15em">Data Description</h5>
									<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
										To avoid confusion, I have only downloaded results from experiment modules that would be of use in a .xls file. The file is then imported as a Python Pandas dataframe with the first column "pidp", which is uniquely representing each participant as the index.

										As shown below, the variable series <i>g_choice</i> are results of the "Time and Risk Preference" module to determine interviewees' time preference and time discount rate; 
										whereas the <i>g_envtax</i> series is from the "Environmental Tax" module to check if the interviewee would support environmental tax; 
										lastly, the <i>g_envhabit</i> is for controlling the interviewees' attitude on enviornmental behaviour from the "Environmental Behaviour and Attitudes" module.

										In the “Environmental Tax” module, respondents were randomly assigned with one of eight questions, 
										consisted with four different settings, each with or without an additional common treatment (i.e. 4 settings x (with + without treatment) = 8 Questions from a to h).
										Hence, a new dataframe <i>envtax_table</i> is created by extracting those related columns from <i>g_indresp</i>. 
									</p>	
									<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
										From the 15 samples below, we can see once respondents were assigned with one of the eight questions,

										With answers from different questions, it will be the most ideal to consider each independtly if data was sufficient.
										However, for simplicity and preserving the staistical power given our small sample size, 
										I am going to disregard the differencecs in settings, which are unrealted to time discounting, 
										and treat all questions as if they were the baseline with (b) or without treatemnt (a).
										Although framing effects are inevitable, I have echoed the experiment designer, Fairbrother (2017) to prove such adverse effect is minmial on our results in Appendix A2.
										Hence, I am going to consolidate the questions into a new variable <i>envtax</i>.

									<p>
										As mentioned, a random treatment was imposed in the “Environmental Tax” module which introduced an additional condition at the end of the question for subjects’ WTP (i.e. b, d, f, h):
										<blockquote>…, if the government reduced other taxes you pay by the same amount?</blockquote>
										For simplicity, treatment will be seen as a direct reduction on proximate financial costs, which as mentioned, has motivated more participants to be more willing to pay environemtnal tax.

									<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
										As the original sample is already limited (N = ??), if answers from each setting were considered separately in five groups, the statistical power would be reduced and risk jeopardising the chance and accuracy of detecting the true result (Button, 2013). 
										Regrettably, the difference in settings would be neglected as if respondents were all asked by either the baseline question (a) or baseline with an additional treatment (b). 
										This is also approved by the experiment designer, Fairbrother (2017), that no significant deviations was found between baseline (a & b) and other qusetion versions (c & d & e & f & g & h).

									</pre>
									<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">	
										Moreover, the effect of treatment in the Primary sample were tested to be homogenous in most settings,
										except in (g), conforming to Fairbrother (2017)’s conclusion that political distrust undermines tax compensation. 
										Therefore, all subjects in setting (h) will be considered as without treatment (i.e. (g) = (h)).
